    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
  I have worked as an iOS Developer for more than 6 years and have mentored interns and juniors during my professional journey. I&#x27;m always looking for performance, innovation and automation, and how I can apply these concepts in the project, process or life. I have experience with projects in the areas of streaming, finance and education. I also have experience in creating SDKs, both for internal use and for sale to third parties.

            <div><ul><li>Responsible for creating an analytics SDK for internal use by the company with the aim of obtaining higher quality data to facilitate the mapping of product improvements. As the SDK could be called by any component at any time, it was necessary to create thread safe components, and to ensure this I created unit tests creating multiple threads and trying to access the resource at the same time. Test coverage for the SDK was around 92%;</li><li>The analytics SDK was also created to support different countries and each with its own domain. There is a buffer to avoid excessive requests and each buffer is linked to the country of the user who generated the events;</li><li>Worked on migrating authentication to using a WebView in which it talked to the app through JavaScript messages;</li><li>Improved the privacy flow with the aim of facilitating expansion to other states/countries that follow different privacy laws;</li><li>Responsible for creating components to serve as bridges between RxSwift - that we are removing from the project - and Combine. The objective was that new features and refactorings do not use third-party frameworks, but to talk to existing components, the mentioned classes would be used.</li></ul></div>

With this, the app could respond in real time with: trivia, advertising/celebration banners and mini games - using web view to load them.</li><li>A chat was also developed to send/receive messages among all users, as well as the possibility of creating groups - which would exist only for that game;</li><li>As it was an SDK used internally but could be sold for integration into third-party teams, it was necessary to configure CI/CD to publish an already compiled version of the SDK and its documentation in a public repository, along with a sample app to guide integration with the SDK;</li><li>Implemented the SDK following MVVM and Clean Architecture to meet the mentioned requirements and provide good maintainability and scalability.</li></ul></div>

Both of them provided live and VOD contents;</li><li>Implemented Fairplay DRM for live and VOD content. It was necessary to use two different logics since each video type worked in a different way. I created an abstraction layer so that the player accepted different DRM implementations;</li><li>Handled different types of VOD such as: multi audio where the audio and subtitle track was disconnected from the video and the user could change any audio/subtitle track without reloading the media; single audio where the audio and subtitles were inserted directly into the media, to change the audio or subtitles it was necessary to load a new media with a predefined configuration, it was not possible to choose just the audio or just the subtitles, the user was forced to change both tracks together; DVB where the subtitle was received in base64 and it was necessary to display it as an image over the content;</li><li>Implemented an architecture with multiple repositories to facilitate maintainability and scalability. There was a repository containing all the business rules and this was imported - using swift package manage - both into the iOS app repository and would be imported into the Apple TV app when it was developed;</li><li>All new features were covered by unit tests and aiming for 80% coverage;</li><li>Implemented a feature to list all channels and their programs, to improve the performance and the time to render the screen to the user, I implemented a custom cache algorithm to avoid unnecessary recalculations and binary search to improve the time to find the current program based on the time.</li></ul></div>
