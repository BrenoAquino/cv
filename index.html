    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
  I have worked as an iOS Developer for more than 6 years and have mentored interns and juniors during my professional journey. I&#x27;m always looking for performance, innovation and automation, and how I can apply these concepts in the project, process or life. I have experience with projects in the areas of streaming, finance and education. I also have experience in creating SDKs, both for internal use and for sale to third parties.

            <div><ul><li>Responsible for creating an analytics SDK for internal use by the company with the aim of obtaining higher quality data to facilitate the mapping of product improvements. As the SDK could be called by any component at any time, it was necessary to create thread safe components, and to ensure this I created unit tests creating multiple threads and trying to access the resource at the same time. Test coverage for the SDK was around 92%;</li><li>The analytics SDK was also created to support different countries and each with its own domain. There is a buffer to avoid excessive requests and each buffer is linked to the country of the user who generated the events;</li><li>Worked on migrating authentication to using a WebView in which it talked to the app through JavaScript messages;</li><li>Improved the privacy flow with the aim of facilitating expansion to other states/countries that follow different privacy laws;</li></ul></div>

All module distributions were using cocoapods. I was responsible for creating and maintaining multiple modules related to the app&#39;s notification/deeplink flow, the app had about 28,000,000 active user per month;</li><li>To support multiple apps in the App Store and avoid duplicate code, it was configured different build schemas and build configurations to define how some components/modules should behave and look;</li><li>Worked on redesigning the app, where I could apply improvements to the app&#39;s architecture and make it more testable and maintainable.</li></ul></div>

With this, the app could respond in real time showing: trivia, advertising/celebration banners and mini games - using web view to load them.</li><li>A chat was also developed to send/receive messages among all users, as well as the possibility of creating groups - which would exist only for that game;</li><li>As it was an SDK used internally but could be sold for integration into third-party teams, it was necessary to configure CI/CD to publish an already compiled version of the SDK and its documentation in a public repository, along with a sample app to guide integration with the SDK;</li><li>Implemented the SDK following MVVM and Clean Architecture to meet the mentioned requirements and provide good maintainability and scalability.</li></ul></div>
