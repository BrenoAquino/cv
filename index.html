            <div><p>I was responsible for defining the project structure with the client (Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment). Together with an android developer, we structured the technical part of the project. I created the SDK following Clean Arch and MVVM. The biggest challenge of this project was that it wasn&#39;t an app, it was an SDK (distributed by Cocoapods) to be integrated with other apps. The project was guided by Agile using Scrum and most meetings were in English.</p></div>

            <div><p>I worked as a Tech lead and iOS developer. The main app which I worked was Unifor Mobile, this app is mobile version of the university platform. The app users can be professors, students or emplyees. The main features were the map, which could guide the user to any main point in the university, the frequency, enabling teachers to make the student frequency in their classes, and enrollment, which allows the students to choose subjects and enroll in the ones they want to. I was reponsible for teaching interns about the tecnology and how the projects work in real world through courses and daily tracking by using scrum. I also contributed to create a set of other apps for the university.</p></div>
